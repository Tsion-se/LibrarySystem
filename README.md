# Library System Project

This is a group project for the Software Engineering course.  
The project demonstrates the use of version control using Git and GitHub.

## Tools and Technologies Used


### Visual Studio Code
- Used to open, edit, and organize the generated Java source files


## Git and GitHub Usage

### Git
Git was used for version control during development.  
The following Git commands were used and understood:

- git init – initialize the repository  
- git add – stage changes  
- git commit – save changes with commit history  
- git branch – create separate branches for each member  
- git checkout – switch between branches  
- git push – upload branches to GitHub  

Commands such as git pull and git merge were understood and used where applicable.  
Because each member worked on a separate branch, pull operations were minimal.

### GitHub
- A public GitHub repository was created for the project
- All group members were added as collaborators
- Each member worked on their own branch using their own GitHub account and email
- Each member committed and pushed their changes to GitHub
- A Pull Request was created for the LoanManagement functionality and merged into the main branch by the group leader


## Branching and Version Control Strategy
- The main branch contains stable code managed by the group leader
- Each group member worked on a separate feature branch
- Commit history shows individual contributions by each member
- Pull Requests were used to demonstrate feature integration and merging
